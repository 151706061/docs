# Account creation

**Accounts we need to create for new team members, services to add people to, etc.**

For notes on how we use these apps/tools/services, see [our list of tools](/how-we-work/tools.md).

### Google Apps

Note: You need to be an owner or have certain admin privileges in our apps account to create users and add them to groups.

**Email**

- Login to [Google Apps](http://apps.google.com) using investigativenewsnetwork.org as the primary domain.
- Go to Users > Add New, select "add a user manually" and then fill out the new user's name and email address (typically firstname@investigativenewsnetwork.org) and allow Google to set their temporary password
- Once the account is created you will get a confirmation message that includes a link to email instructions to the new user, you'll want to do this so they have the temporary password and know how to login and set up their account.

**Groups**

- Also managed from [Google Apps](http://apps.google.com)
- There are a variety of groups setup for various projects but the main one new team members need to be added to is nerds@investigativenewsnetwork.org so they receive all of the email to the shared team account.
- To add someone to this group go to Groups > Technology > Manage users in group, add the new team member using their @INN email address and select "add as member"

**Calendar**

- We have a shared Google Calendar (INN - Technology) that all team members should be added to.
- From Google Calendar, click on the down arrow by the calendar name and select "share this calendar"
- Team members should be added using their @INN email address and the permissions will typically be "make changes to events AND manage sharing"

### HipChat

Note: HipChat account creation can only be done by someone with Admin/Owner privileges.

- Add new account using @INN email address (will send user an email invitation)
- An admin/owner to technology room(s)
- New user will need to click on a confirmation link in the email invitation
- And optionally they can download the HipChat desktop/mobile apps from the [HipChat website](http://hipchat.com)
