# Communication Tools

These are some of the tools we rely on to make our remote work possible.

- **[Slack](https://slack.com/):** We use this as our group chat tool and always-on back channel. We have three channels we primarily use: a room for all INN staff (#00-inn-staff) a room restricted to our team only (#00-tech team) and a room that is open to all tech folks at partner/member organizations (#00-open-tech). In addition we create a channel for each project we work on to collaborate internally and also, at times, with members/partners/vendors.
- **[GitHub](http://www.github.com):** For versioning and hosting our open source projects. We have a number of teams under our [INN organization account](http://github.com/inn) to grant access to various groups of projects to various types of users: 
	- **Owners** have read/write/admin access to all team projects
	- **Tech Team** has read/write/admin to a smaller subset of our projects
	- **All INN Staff** has read/write access to a number of repositories relevant to all INN staff
	- **Secret** is only for people who have permission to deploy to production (this should always be limited to only core team members who are comfortable with our git workflow, deployment process and hosting infrastructure)
- **[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org):** Versioning and hosting for [Largo](http://largoproject.org) child themes for all the member sites we host. This allows us to add devs at member organizations to a repo just for their child theme so they can commit changes to a theme for us to review and push to production.
- **[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira):** For project management, planning sprints and iteration cycles, time tracking, and service desk features
- **[Bee](http://www.neat.io/bee/):** Combines issues and tickets from JIRA, GitHub and others into a streamlined interface. Also offers time tracking and task prioritization.
- **[Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/):** Remote pair programming software
- **[Google Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/hangouts):** For [meetings](meetings.md) like our daily scrum and for public events like our monthly [book club meetings](/projects/book-club/) and [open office hours](/projects/office-hours/).
- **[Google Calendar](https://www.google.com/calendar/):** for coordinating our schedules and creating recurring events with hangout invites associated with them. We have a shared calendar (INN - Technology) that we're all able to add events to and we use this for things like recurring events, team meetings and deadlines for conference submissions, travel, vacations, etc.
- **Email:** For email correspondence we use inn.org email addresses managed through Google Apps. If you have multiple email addresses you may want to forward this to a primary address. Here are instructions on how to do that in [Gmail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/10957?hl=en), [Apple Mail](https://support.apple.com/kb/PH2642?locale=en_US) or [Microsoft Outlook](https://support.office.com/en-ca/article/Automatically-forward-my-messages-to-another-e-mail-account-9f124e4a-749e-4288-a266-2d009686b403). There are also some group email addresses setup in Google Apps for various purposes. Check with your supervisor to make sure you've been added to the relevant groups as part of your onboarding.
- **[Dropbox](http://dropbox.com)** for file sharing.
- **[1password](https://agilebits.com/onepassword)** for password management (synced to everyone's computers/devices using dropbox)

We also maintain [a large list of tools and services](http://nerds.inn.org/discounts/) (including many of the above) that offer discounts to nonprofits on our team blog.
