# Communication Tools

These are some of the tools we rely on to make our remote work possible. 

- **[HipChat](https://www.hipchat.com/):** We use this as our group chat tool and always-on back channel
- **[GitHub](http://www.github.com):** For versioning and hosting our open source projects
- **[Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org):** Versioning and hosting for [Largo](http://largoproject.org) child themes for all the member sites we host. This allows us to add devs at member organizations to a repo just for their child theme so they can commit changes to a theme for us to review and push to production.
- **[JIRA](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira):** For project management, planning sprints and iteration cycles, time tracking, and service desk features
- **[Screenhero](https://screenhero.com/):** Remote pair programming software
- **[Google Hangouts](https://plus.google.com/hangouts):** For [meetings](meetings.md) and daily scrum

We maintain [a large list of tools and services](http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org/discounts/) (including many of the above) that offer discounts to nonprofits on our team blog.
