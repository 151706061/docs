# How We Work

Notes on how we work together as a team.

### What's in here (so far):
-  [What we've learned about working as a remote team](remote-work.md)
-  [The tools we use](tools.md)
-  [Meetings](meetings.md) - Description of our general meeting philosophy, daily scrum and weekly recap meetings

### Still todo:
-  flesh out the [process doc](process.md)
-  Issue tracking procedure (maybe this is just a section of the process doc)
