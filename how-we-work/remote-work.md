# Working remotely

INN has a distributed team, which means we work in different locations and time zones and sometimes in our pajamas. Working from home full time also means we have to think more intentionally about communication and work-life balance.

### We're not tied to our machines
It's all too easy to get sucked into our work and not surface for hours at a time. To counteract this sort of faux-productivity, we try to take a lot of walks and other short breaks away from our screens. Snacks are important, too. 

### Communication
We use HipChat, IM, and Google Hangouts to stay in touch with each other throughout the day. We start every day with scrum, which helps everyone know what they should be working on and whether anyone else on the team needs something from them. Our weekly staff meeting gives us space to discuss the bigger picture stuff, along with our current projects. Read more about our [communication tools](ADD LINK).

### Boundaries
Remote work offers the flexibility of setting your own schedule, but it also means you can feel like you're working 24/7. In addition to taking regular breaks, we try hard to set boundaries around our work each day. Work reasonable hours. Don't send or expect responses to non-emergency email after hours. Taking time to _not_ work makes our working time more productive.

### Motivation
Building habits and routines can help prevent the feeling of disconnect or isolation. Have a dedicated space in your home where you "go to work." Put on pants. If something isn't working, or you start to struggle with lack of direction or motivation, speak up. You probably aren't alone. Take advantage of coworking spaces in your town or the tried and true coffee shop work session.

### IRL time
We get together in person a few times a year. It helps us stay connected and is a great opportunity to work on long term planning and projects.
