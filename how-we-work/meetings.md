Meeting Guidelines
------------------

-  **Avoid unnecessary meetings.** Meetings are time-consuming, expensive and leave less time for periods of focused, uninterrupted work. 
-  **Most meetings are unnecessary.** Never schedule a meeting when email, IM or a quick hangout or phone call will do.
-  **Use asynchronous communication wherever possible** Prefer, in this order: chat or IM > individual phone/video calls > meetings or video chats > conference calls
-  **All meetings start on time.** Be respectful of your colleagues' and our partners' time and don't keep them waiting.
-  **Test technology ahead of time.** If we're going to use a video chat or screensharing tool, make sure it works ahead of time so we don't spend half of the meeting wrestling with the technology.


<a id="scrum"></a>
Daily Scrum
-----------

-  Every weekday at 10 AM ET
-  Uses the Google Hangout link from the recurring event invite on the team Google calendar
-  Starts on time, no exceptions
-  Never longer than 15 minutes
-  Literally stand up
-  Scrum Master role rotates week to week

Each team member answers three questions (no more than 2 minutes per person):

-  What did you do yesterday?
-  What are you planning to do today?
-  Do you have any blockers?

Scrum Master schedules any necessary follow-up to remove blockers.

It's important to acknowledge anything keeping you from accomplishing your tasks and make the team aware of them so we can try to help; don't be shy.

No detailed discussion of issues during this meeting.
