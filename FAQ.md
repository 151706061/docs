#### Q: How do I add JavaScript to posts?

**A:** In the Post's **edit** screen, select the **text** view *not* the visual edit view, and put your JavaScript in there. Save it and preview it from the **text** view and it should work just fine.

#### Q: How do I create a custom excerpt field to determine what's in the preview blurb?

**A:** WordPress has a custom excerpt field that is sometimes hidden by default:

* Go into the Post's **edit** screen
* Click on **screen options** at the top right corner of the page
* Check the box for **excerpt** and you'll see the excerpt below the main body of the post

#### Q: How do I change the color of the Theme?
**A:** The default color is light blue. Here is how you choose a different color:

* Under **Appearance** > **Theme Options** there is an **Advanced tab** that has an option to **enable custom LESS to CSS for theme customization**
*  Check that box and **save the theme options**
*  On the **Appearance** > **CSS Variables** menu that appears, you can now do some basic customization of the theme (mostly colors)
*  You can use custom CSS to further refine the colors, but this will generally reduce the amount of custom CSS you need to use
