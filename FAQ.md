#### Q: How do I add JavaScript to posts?

**A:** In the Post's **edit** screen, select the **text** view *not* the visual edit view, and put your JavaScript in there. Save it and preview it from the **text** view and it should work just fine.

#### Q: How do I create a custom excerpt field to determine what's in the preview blurb?

**A:** WordPress has a custom excerpt field that is sometimes hidden by default:

* Go into the Post's **edit** screen
* Click on **screen options** at the top right corner of the page
* Check the box for **excerpt** and you'll see the excerpt below the main body of the post
<hr>

#### Q: How do I change the color of the Theme?
**A:** The default color is light blue. Here is how you choose a different color:

* Under **Appearance** > **Theme Options** there is an **Advanced tab** that has an option to **enable custom LESS to CSS for theme customization**
*  Check that box and **save the theme options**
*  On the **Appearance** > **CSS Variables** menu that appears, you can now do some basic customization of the theme (mostly colors)
*  You can use custom CSS to further refine the colors, but this will generally reduce the amount of custom CSS you need to use

#### Q: Can I change the size of the text on the Nav bars and Widgets?
**A:** No, you can't change those values in the Admin UI. That can only be done through custom CSS. We have tested this theme extensively for appearance on desktop to mobile devices to ensure that these elements display properly in all screen sizes. Changing this is not recommended. While you may improve the appearance in one view, it will often look worse on a different device.
