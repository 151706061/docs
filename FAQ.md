#### Q: How do I add JavaScript to posts?

**A:** In the Post's **edit** screen, select the **text** view *not* the visual edit view, and put your JavaScript in there. Save it and preview it from the **text** view and it should work just fine.

#### Q: How do I create a custom excerpt field to determine what's in the preview blurb?

**A:** WordPress has a custom excerpt field that is sometimes hidden by default:

* Go into the Post's **edit** screen
* Click on **screen options** at the top right corner of the page
* Check the box for **excerpt** and you'll see the excerpt below the main body of the post

#### Q: How do I change the color of the Theme?
**A:** The default color is light blue. Here is how you choose a different color:

* Under **Appearance** > **Theme Options** there is an **Advanced tab** that has an option to **enable custom LESS to CSS for theme customization**
*  Check that box and **save the theme options**
*  On the **Appearance** > **CSS Variables** menu that appears, you can now do some basic customization of the theme (mostly colors)
*  You can use custom CSS to further refine the colors, but this will generally reduce the amount of custom CSS you need to use

#### Q: Can I change the size of the text on the Nav bars and Widgets?
**A:** No, you can't change those values in the Admin UI. That can only be done through custom CSS. We have tested this theme extensively for appearance on desktop to mobile devices to ensure that these elements display properly in all screen sizes. Changing this is not recommended. While you may improve the appearance in one view, it will often look worse on a different device.

#### Q: How do I change the prominence of posts and other items?
**A:** When you edit a post you'll see a number of boxes in the right column with various checkboxes (categories, etc.) one of these is labelled **Prominence**. This controls where certain posts are displayed on the site (i.e. The **top story** on the homepage is selected by checking the **Top Story** box).

* By default, the footer has a widget called **Footer Featured** that will show up to three posts that you select by checking the **Footer Featured widget** box from this prominence box when editing a post
* If you don't see the pProminence box, make sure you're in the **Post Edit** screen, click on **Screen Options** at the top right corner of the screen and make sure the **Prominence** box is checked

#### Q: We switched to a new host, but it's still pointing to the old site. How long does it take for those changes to propagate?
**A:** While the changes may propagate within a couple hours, it can actually take up to **48 hours** for them to take effect. If you **clear your cache** and **try the site from a new internet browser** and still see the old site, or it's pointing to the old host, the changes have not taken effect yet, and you just have to wait it out.
