## Daily Scrum

-  Every weekday at 10 AM ET
-  Uses the Google Hangout link from the recurring event invite
-  Starts on time, no exceptions
-  Never longer than 15 minutes
-  Scrum Master role rotates week to week

Each team member answers three questions (no more than 2 minutes per person):

-  What did you do yesterday?
-  What are you planning to do today?
-  Do you have any blockers?

Scrum Master schedules any necessary follow-up to remove blockers. 

No detailed discussion of issues during this meeting.
