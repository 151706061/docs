# Editor Responsibilities

Like all of our recurring programs, we take turns editing our newsletter each month. Here's what the editor for that month is responsible for:

- Managing the creation, publication and archiving of that month's newsletters
- Growing our subscriber list

And then for each newsletter:

- [ ] Reach out to potential guest contributors by EOD Monday each week. Request that they submit their content by Thursday for inclusion in Friday's newsletter

- [ ] Ensure all newsletter content is delivered and in the draft Google doc by end of day Thursday

- [ ] Have all newsletter content moved over to MailChimp and ready for edit by 12 p.m. CT on Friday

- [ ] Complete all of the tasks in the [pre-publish checklist](/checklists/newsletter.md)

- [ ] Add newsletter content to the blog as a draft (reference the [blog post checklist](/checklists/blog-post.md) for more details)

- [ ] Newsletter sent via MailChimp by 2 p.m. CT on Friday

- [ ] Publish newsletter post on the blog after the email is sent

- [ ] Share newsletter blog link on social platforms

- [ ] Move content from the [draft Google doc](https://docs.google.com/a/investigativenewsnetwork.org/document/d/1DlgHsgSN4Z-uOIUqUg3PcQYLsyYftnRIEEWLbjxlNlg/edit) to the [archive Google spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/a/investigativenewsnetwork.org/spreadsheets/d/1bRKcDupgokDEOaNBlpbsn8-t-eD99FW8G5CoW-ZEmNo/edit)
