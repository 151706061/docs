# Newsletter Pre-Publish Checklist

### Before sending the Friday newsletter:

- [ ] Load content into MailChimp template and proof *(Login in the INN 1password vault)*

- [ ] Send test email from MailChimp to [nerds@inn.org](mailto:nerds@inn.org) and any apprentices not on the nerds@inn.org list.

- [ ] Make sure at least two other team members read through the test email for style, grammar, link checks and gut checks about any questionable content choices.

- [ ] Check each link and confirm it works

- [ ] Run images and GIFs through [an optimizer](http://ezgif.com/optimize)

- [ ] Proof subject line(s) with extra care

- [ ] Check for any exclusionary language ("guys" and "dudes," etc.) or offensive content

- [ ] Do a final call for newsletter sign ups on social media

### After sending the Friday newsletter:

- [ ] Create INN Nerds Blog Post and publish. This is the link to share.

- [ ] Use TweetDeck with the @INNNerds twitter to tweet the nerds.inn.org link. Don't just stick to the subject line. Emoji and/or the newsletter GIF help.

- [ ] Notify ye fellow Nerds to share with their followers.

- [ ] But wait, now it's time to schedule some more tweets:
  1. If there was a guest, definitely make sure a Thank You happens. Preferably from your personal account (for the personal touch), but at minimum the @INNNerds. Schedule for post Office Hours. @tag the guest if they're clearly a public Twitter person.
  2. Schedule ICYMI tweet for Sunday Evening catchup time (4-5 PM PT / 7-8 PM ET)
  3. If we made a thing, tweet that thing! Give 15-45 minute padding from other scheduled tweets. If it was a Largo thing, perhaps tweet from @LargoProject and RT onto @INNNerds. If it's a BIG thing, don't be stingy -- space a few more tweets throughout the next week.
  4. *Optional* - Schedule the shoutout + link-off if it is a particularly cool thing. Tag the org. Monday morning (8 AM PT / 11 AM ET) is a good time.


### Tips
- **On writing**... less is more.
- **On MailChimp**... careful of pasting in the MailChimp WYSIWYG. Check mode or edit raw code. You don't want to wipe out existing styles.
- **On GIFs**... Keep the gif between 400-500 wide, shorter than 3.33 seconds. [Resize it and optimize it](http://ezgif.com/optimize).
- **On TweetDeck**... when scheduling text, TweetDeck allows Scheduled Tweets to be re-timed. When scheduling images, you must delete the tweet and start over :[
