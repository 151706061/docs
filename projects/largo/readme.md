# Largo

### What is it?

An open source WordPress framework we built to make it easier to make websites for our members.

### Who made it?

Originally, we started from NPR's [Project Argo](https://github.com/argoproject/Argo), so kudos to them for getting the ball rolling.

The early work on Largo was done by Adam Schweigert but we've since benefitted from the contributions of everyone on the INN team and a number of [open source contributors](https://github.com/INN/Largo/graphs/contributors).
