# INN Nerds Open Office Hours

Open office hours the first Thursday of the month from 3-5 p.m. CT.

Members can sign up for a 30 minute (or more if you clear it with us in advance) block to meet with our entire team and get feedback on any tech related issues you might be facing (new project ideas, critique of works in progress, general tech/strategy/design questions).

Since we're a remote team, these will be Google hangouts and can be either public (anyone can join or watch) or private (if you want to keep the conversation just between us).
