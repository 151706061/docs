# INN Nerds Open Office Hours

We're a small team and we're typically juggling a lot of projects and can find it hard to answer questions (particularly those not related to the products we build and support) from individual INN members in the course of our regular work days.

But we want to be accessible, approachable and create an opportunity for our members (and members of the journalism and tech community at large) to ask us about any tech-related issues.

One of the ways we will create this opportunity is to hold open office hours on the first Thursday of the month from 3-5 p.m. CT.

Anyone can sign up for a 30 minute (or more if you clear it with us in advance) block to meet with our entire team and get feedback on any tech related issues you might be facing (new project ideas, critique of works in progress, general tech/strategy/design questions, etc.).

INN members will get priority and signups will open directly after our monthly hangout for the following month. If space is available, we will open the signups to any organization or individual on the Monday before each month's hangout.

Since we're a remote team, these will be Google hangouts and can be either public (anyone can join or watch) or private (if you want to keep the conversation just between us). Please let us know your preference when you email us to signup for a slot.

If you'd like to sign up for a slot, just send us an email at [nerds@investigativenewsnetwork.org](mailto:nerds@investigativenewsnetwork.org).
