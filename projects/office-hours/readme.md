# INN Nerds Open Office Hours

We're a small team juggling a lot of projects. There's not always much time to answer questions (particularly those not directly related to the products we build and support) or to give thoughtful feedback on projects that people bring to us.

But we want to be accessible, approachable and create an opportunity for INN members (and members of the journalism and tech community at large) to ask us about any tech-related issues they may have or to get feedback on their projects.

So we set aside some dedicated time every month as a team to do just that.

**We hold our open office hours on the first Thursday of the month from 3-5 p.m. CT.** For now we're this once a month, but we might do them more frequently if there's sufficient demand.

**Anyone can sign up** for a 30-minute block to meet with our entire team and get feedback on tech-related issues you might be facing (new project ideas, critique of works in progress, general tech/strategy/design questions, etc.). You can sign up for a longer block of time if you clear it with us in advance.

[Here's the signup sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1p-twn2D8oow7vXBfkcdYcZnVA4z8Q42OMs77KlHwf-g/edit).

INN members will get priority but, if space is available, we'll open the signups to any organization or individual on the Monday before each month's hangout. If we're already booked, you can put yourself on the waitlist and we'll let you know if a spot becomes available.

Since we're a remote team, these will be **Google hangouts** (the persistent link for this hangout is [right here](https://plus.google.com/hangouts/_/investigativenewsnetwork.org/office-hours)).

Hangouts are sometimes a pain, particularly if you're on a slow internet connection. When you join the hangout, try to be on time for your scheduled slot and be on a fast enough connection so we don't have to spend too much time troubleshooting technical issues.

If you know you might have connectivity issues, **it is also possible to join a hangout by phone** (just [email us the phone number](mailto:nerds@inn.org) you want us to call before the hangout and we'll dial you in.

**The default for these hangouts will be public** because we think sharing ideas in the open helps everyone learn and improve but if you want to keep the conversation just between us, indicate that on the signup sheet and we'll boot people out and make the hangout invite only when your time slot comes around. If you're wondering how to create your own Google Hangouts that are open to anyone, we have a [tutorial on that right here](/projects/tools.md).

**The format for these is really determined by the type of questions or issues you have.** To make the most of our time together you might want to prepare a list of questions or [email us](mailto:nerds@inn.org) some background information, links to your website/project, git repos, etc. ahead of time so we can take a quick look and be better prepared to help you out.

If you have any **questions or suggestions** for us on how to make these office hours work best for you and your organization, email us anytime: [nerds@inn.org](mailto:nerds@inn.org).
