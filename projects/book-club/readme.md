# INN Nerds Book Club

Once a month, we'll pick a book, read it and host a public Google Hangout to discuss it.

Here's [our original announcement](http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org/2014/09/02/come-learn-with-us-announcing-the-news-nerd-book-club/) of the program describing why we're doing this and what we hope to accomplish.

To pick which book gets read each month, we'll take suggestions via [@newsnerdbooks](https://twitter.com/newsnerdbooks) or in-person at the end of each book club meeting. Then, we'll post a survey (using Google Forms) where anyone can choose from the list of suggestions to cast their vote for the book of the month.

We also maintain [a running list of book suggestions](https://hackpad.com/News-Nerd-Book-Club-Reading-List-YAApSL79SO2) on hackpad.

Once a book is selected, we'll let everyone know which book made the cut on our Twitter account, [@newsnerdbooks](https://twitter.com/newsnerdbooks) and a post on the [team's blog](http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org/). You can find all of our [past book club books and blog posts here](http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org/category/book-club/).

For remote meetings (most months) we'll create a Google Plus event listing, which will include a link to the public Google Hangout where the discussion will happen. If you'd like to know how to set up a Google Plus event with a public Google Hangout, [click here](/projects/tools.md#google-hangouts).

For in-person meetings (likely a couple times a year at conferences) we'll create an Eventbrite listing with details so people can RSVP because we'll need a rough count to make sure we choose an appropriate venue. 

Wherever possible, there should be pie.
