# INN Nerds Book Club

Once a month, we'll pick a book, read it and host a public Google Hangout to discuss it.

To pick which book gets read, we'll take suggestions via [@newsnerdbooks](https://twitter.com/newsnerdbooks) or in-person at the end of each book club meeting. Then, we'll post a survey where anyone can choose from the list of suggestions to cast their vote for the book of the month.

Once a book is selected, we'll let everyone know which book made the cut via [@newsnerdbooks](https://twitter.com/newsnerdbooks) and a post on the [team's blog](http://nerds.investigativenewsnetwork.org/).

We'll create a Google Plus event listing for the book club, which will include a link to the public Google Hangout where the discussion will happen.
