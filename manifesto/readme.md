## Mission
[TK: Two or three sentence synopsis of our team’s purpose.]

### Always be learning/Growth (mentorship/teaching)
We will host a monthly book club for the news nerd community
We’ll pair program and share what we learn with each other (redundancy)
We’ll document the new things we learn and share them publicly
We’ll attend local and national events/user-groups, stay involved in journalism community
We’ll invest in education (creating curriculum and training for members, and investing in apprentices/students, and training ourselves in new things)
Experiment with new tools and processes — None of that “this is the way we’ve always done it”
This list can change. All things are transitory (<--too fancy)


### Openness — to new ideas, approaches, being wrong (admitting when we’re wrong or don’t know), sharing/showing our work
Document and show our work, release code open source
Blog about our processes and projects
Welcome new ideas and approaches
Post office hours, be available for questions and communication
We’ll lead efforts to make documentation in journalism better and useful

### Diversity — Diversity of ideas, perspectives, gender, race, orientation, etc. As we hire and grow, we want our team to represent …. Want to do better than legacy journalism (with everything, really)
Individuality — hiring well rounded people who do stuff
KEEP INN WEIRD
When hiring, we will post jobs publicly and leave them open long enough to recruit a more diverse pool of candidates
Proactively reach out to people in less-represented communities
Talk about it publicly and hold ourselves and others accountable
We will always pay our not-interns (apprentices) 
Pedantry is a force, of the privileged oppressor ?! literally.

### Money - value the work we do, sustainability, etc.
We will charge for our time at a fair market value
We will work to create products that make our work sustainable and makes nonprofit journalism more sustainable
We will be careful stewards of the money we receive from clients and foundations. We swear we won’t buy islands or shit

### Empathy — treating each other as whole human beings, meeting clients where they are, be nice not snarky. Personal shit happens. Carry each other. 
The kindness panda (we’ll hold each other accountable for staying positive)
We won’t make fun of clients or members to their faces. Only in the secret repo
Life happens: When personal stuff comes up, we’ll support each other and help carry the workload.
We’ll never judge you or shame you for not knowing something
We won’t feign surprise or give you a “Well, actually.” (source: hacker school CoC)

### Making things better — building up vs. tearing down, contributing to community. Everything’s gonna be awesome.
We’ll actively contribute to the journalism community
We’ll leave things better than how we found them
We will focus on building and creating, not tearing down what doesn’t work
We will host hackathon-style events for nonprofit journalism/journalists to learn and build community
We’re in this together — we won’t trash our colleagues at other orgs or ….
We believe in journalism that furthers democracy, challenges corruption, and dismantles structural oppression. We will support our members and community in doing this work.

### Members first/service — We are not more important than our members. We are not too cool for school. But we will be opinionated and help them do the best work possible. Service but not at the expense of excellence. Humble excellence.
The things we build should directly benefit our members and clients
We’re not in it for the glory, but we’re committed to helping people do digital journalism better and stuff

### Thoughtfulness — follow through in process (our own projects and how we support clients, not leaving people high and dry, cradle to grave planning)
Our processes will be thoroughly documented
We will interrogate project ideas and features before building
We’ll follow through on the things we ship
We won’t follow a trend just because it’s new or shiny
We won’t make knee-jerk decisions because somebody feels panicked

### Honesty/Telling the truth — Setting boundaries when we have to, taking projects we care about and are reasonable, “Is this a project we should take on” checklist. Being able to talk about how things aren’t working (add to meetings section of docs)
We’ll say no — and we’ll always explain why
We will be honest with each other about what’s not working for us
We’ll make space to discuss obstacles at our daily scrum
We’ll choose clients and projects that are doing work we care about and represents us as a team/organization
We will be clear about our process and time tracking, so clients know what they are paying for


### Fun — Music, food, cocktails, snacks
embrace pie
eat all the things
