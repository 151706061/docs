### Where should I host my Largo site?
* [WP Engine](http://wpengine.com) This is what we use for all the Largo sites and are a dedicated WordPress-only hosting company. They are great for our purpose, but if you want to host anything else on the same server or do a lot of customization they might not be the best option. They can also be a bit expensive depending on your needs.

* At one time, we used a service similar to WP Engine called [pagely](http://pagely.com) as a backup for a couple sites. It's highly optimized for WordPress and is WordPress-only. It is also a bit on the expensive side.

* There is a service called [Pantheon](https://www.getpantheon.com) we've heard good things about, (but haven't used). They traditionally just did Drupal hosting, but have recently added a WordPress product to their lineup. 

The reason we typically recommend these over Rackspace (or anywhere that you'd have to do more configuration) is that these dedicated services focus on just doing one thing really well (hosting WordPress sites) so they tend to be a lot better on the performance and security front than lower-end hosting companies. They're also better able to handle the **high volume** that news sites sometimes experience. 

Hosting on Rackspace or Amazon Web Services can certainly work, but it typically means more effort on your part to get things up and running, perform maintenance and updates, etc. If you need to pay somebody to do all those things for you, that can often outweigh the added cost of the more specialized services that already handle it for you.
