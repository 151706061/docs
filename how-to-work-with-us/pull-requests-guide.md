## Anatomy of a Pull Request and Submission Protocol
====================

A pull request (PR) is a request to merge changes you have made to the master branch. Here are some guidelines for what information to include in your PR, when to submit a PR, and when to wait to submit one. Remember that a PR is part of a process to document the changes to a product or procedure, so the more information you provide, the better you and your teammates will understand the purpose of the PR.

### What information to include in a PR

**A PR should contain commits that are related and that address only one functional change. If you made changes to unrelated documents,  projects, or various functionalities, submit multiple PRs.**

To explain your PR, include:

 - Explain what issues (and specific issue numbers) the PR fixes

- Explain **why** you chose to make these changes - what is your reasoning?

- Include any new issues or conflicts to code or design that your changes create

- Include screenshots or useful links to explain your PR

### Answers to FAQs

##### When should I submit a PR?
Submit a PR when you have finished making complete changes to one functionality, related documents or code and are ready for our team to review your work. Minor fixes are fine to pull, especially if they correct ambiguous or incorrect languages or code. 

##### When should I *not* submit a PR?
Wait to submit a PR if you still have more edits to do or more content to add. Make more commits and combine them into one PR if they are related to the same fix. **Do not be intimidated to submit PR!** When in doubt, ask our team for help. 

##### What should I expect after submitting a PR?
After your submit a PR, team members will get a chance to review your work. Your PR may undergo changes before it is merged, so don't be surprised, discouraged, or hurt if we ask you to change things or if we make changes ourselves.
