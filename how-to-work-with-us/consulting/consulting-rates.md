# Consulting Rates

As of August 2014 the hourly rates for our paid consulting work are as follows:

-  **For INN member organizations** we offer a highly discounted hourly rate of $50 per hour. This is slightly below our cost and is subsidized by the other consulting work we do for non-members and by INN's general operating funds (grants we receive from foundations, member dues, etc.)
-  **For non-member non-profit organizations** we offer a substantially reduced hourly rate of $100 per hour.
-  **For non-member, for-profit organizations** our base hourly rate is $150 per hour.

These rates are subject to change and we will review them periodically, but once we agree to an hourly rate we will honor it per the terms of your contract.
