## Code of conduct and how to contribute

1. Be welcoming, friendly and patient; kind, courteous and respectful.
2. Use your best judgment — always do the right thing.

### What this means

- When someone disagrees with you, take the time to understand why. Always expect an explanation.
- Give **constructive** criticism, expect the same in return.
    - Dismissing an idea out of hand is unacceptable. An explanation and support for an argument are required.
- Be a professional. Remember that this is a public space and choose your words accordingly. Harassment and exclusionary behavior are not acceptable.

### Contributing code

- Send us pull requests for bug fixes and small suggestions.
- For feature requests, create an issue to start a discussion. We’ll decide together whether or not the requested feature gets built. Be sure and explain clearly why your feature request is essential.
