# How to Work With Us

We love making things and helping our members and clients create great journalism. We want to make it easy for you to approach us with ideas and projects, and we want you to know what to expect when working with us.

**When you approach us with a project**, we'll talk about the idea as a team and review the requirements and expectations. We recommend you familiarize yourself with our process so you know what to expect. [Add link to our process doc when it is done!]()

**You'll hear back from us within TK**, at which point we'll let you know whether we can work the project into our schedule and some intitial ideas about direction. We'll also provide an estimate of how long we expect the project to take.

**When working on a project with us**, expect to receive weekly updates and opportunities for review and feedback.
