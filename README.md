# INN News Applications And Technology Team Docs

## Table of Contents

What's in here (so far):

-  Some [sample job postings/descriptions](/job-descriptions) we've used to recruit and hire the team

What is not (and will not) be in here:

-  Documentation for [Largo](http://largoproject.org) which is kept in a Confluence knowledgebase
-  Documentation for our other apps/tools/etc. (e.g. our [deployment tools](https://github.com/INN/deploy-tools) or our [responsive tables](https://github.com/INN/responsive-tables) rig) which will typically reside within those repos directly
