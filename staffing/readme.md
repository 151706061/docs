# Staffing and Hiring

How we write job descriptions, approach recruiting, evaluate candidates and help them get started when they join our team.

### What's in here (so far):

-  [A few job postings](/staffing/job-descriptions) from our hiring process and from member organizations
-  [Sample interview questions](/staffing/interview-questions.md) we use for screening candidates (usually with a few additional questions that are unique to each position)
-  [Onboarding resources](/staffing/onboarding/readme.md) for new team members

### Still to-do:

-  Recruiting/staffing (team composition, how we handle recruiting, resources)
