# Staffing and Hiring

How we write job descriptions, approach recruiting and evaluate candidates.

### What's in here (so far):

-  [A few job postings we've used recently](/staffing/job-descriptions)
-  [Sample interview questions](/staffing/interview-questions.md) we use for screening candidates (usually with a few additional questions that are unique to each position)

### Still to-do:

-  Recruiting/staffing (team composition, how we handle recruiting, resources)
