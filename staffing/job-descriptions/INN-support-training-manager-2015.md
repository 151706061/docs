# Manager of Support, Training and Documentation

The Institute for Nonprofit News (INN, formerly the Investigative News Network), a network of 100+ nonprofit news organizations, has an opening for a **full-time manager of support, training and documentation** on our technology and product team.

As a team, we exist to support the work of our member organizations, many of which are small nonprofits with limited technology resources. We focus primarily on problems that we are uniquely suited to tackle at a network level, for example:

-  Hosting and supporting over 40 member websites using a WordPress-powered platform/framework we've built and maintain - [http://largoproject.org](http://largoproject.org)
-  Building open source tools to support members' editorial work and presentation needs with the goal of making their work look as great as any of the largest for-profit newsrooms
-  Providing technology consulting, training and resources to help increase the overall level of tech knowledge and ability across the network

You can read more about us [on our team blog](http://nerds.inn.org) and check out [our projects on github](http://github.com/inn).

We are a small (but growing!) team of makers and this key role on our team would be responsible for helping design, implement and manage our support instructure, while also assisting with project management, documentation and training programs.

The ideal candidate for this position is a detail-oriented self starter who wants to help us provide exemplary service to INN members and our paid consulting clients. This person should have experience making things for the web, a passion for sharing what they know with others and be excited about being a leader in creating documentation and training resources to assist both members and non-members in their adoption of the Largo platform and the other tools and applications we build.

**Responsibilities:**

-  Be the lead person on our team providing front-line support to member organizations and our paid consulting clients, including responding to member/client questions, troubleshooting and documenting issues, routing requests and providing quality control to ensure that our process is well-designed and efficient and that our fixes meet client expectations and are delivered on time.
-  Perform bug fixes, design/theme changes, etc. in response to member/client requests.
-  Identify, communicate and help prioritize new feature requests as well as assist in the design and development of new features for the Largo platform.
-  Create documentation to assist publishers in the adoption and use of the Largo platform (and in some cases our other tools and applications)such as technical documentation, installation guides, step-by-step walkthroughs of key features, new feature announcements, FAQs, case studies, screencasts, etc.
-  Occasionally assist in the planning and implementation of group and/or individualized training (mostly virtual via webinars or asynchronous online courses but also possibly in-person) to help publishers maximize the use of the Largo platform and other tools/apps we build.
-  Manage and continuously improve our support workflow and project management process.
-  Write and edit content for newsletters, the team blog, social media, etc. to promote our projects and help organizations maximize their use of the tools we build.

**Requirements:**

-  Interest in helping nonprofit news organizations become more adept with technology and maximize their use of the tools we build
-  Strong written and verbal communication skills, experience with direct client interaction and front-line support strongly preferred
-  Previous experience creating end-user documentation, style guides, etc. Some technical writing experience and familiarity with developer documentation would also be helpful
-  Experience training and explaining technical concepts to non-technical users (previous experience conducting webinars or creating video training would be helpful)
-  Strong attention to detail, previous project management experience highly preferred
-  Highly organized self-starter able to develop project plans and work to implement them with limited oversight and supervision
-  Familiarity with help desk, knowledgebase and project management tools and workflows (we use Atlassian’s Jira and Confluence)

While much of this role is writing, customer service and project management, we also need this person so be able to jump in, fully own the resolution of support requests and perform some technical tasks. To be successful in this role, the ideal candidate should have:

-  Intermediate front-end design/development skills (HTML/CSS and some JavaScript)
-  Experience developing for WordPress (particularly theme development in a multisite environment) and some knowledge of PHP/MySQL
-  Familiarity with basic principles of user-centered design, ideally in a news environment
-  Familiarity with version control tools (we use git)

This is a **full-time position with benefits**. Our compensation package is commensurate with experience and extremely competitive. We are also committed to giving our employees the tools they need to do their job and supporting their professional growth so you'll get an allowance for hardware, software, travel to conferences, etc.

Our team is distributed so **remote candidates are fine** as long as you're comfortable with that. Previous experience working remotely would be helpful. If you'd rather work with us (in the same room) we have team members in Columbus (Ohio), Chicago, Minneapolis and Kansas City or you could work out of INN's home office in Encino, CA.

**INN is an equal opportunity employer** and we are committed to creating a workplace where diversity is valued. In addition to federal law requirements, INN complies with applicable state and local laws governing nondiscrimination in employment in every location in which the company has facilities.
