# Account creation

**Accounts we need to create for new team members, services to add people to, etc.**

For notes on how we use these apps/tools/services, see [our list of tools](/how-we-work/tools.md).


### Google Apps

Note: You need to be an owner or have certain admin privileges in our apps account to create users and add them to groups.

**Email**

- Login to [Google Apps](http://apps.google.com) using inn.org as the primary domain.
- Go to Users > Add New, select "add a user manually" and then fill out the new user's name and email address (typically firstname@inn.org) and allow Google to set their temporary password
- Once the account is created you will get a confirmation message that includes a link to email instructions to the new user, you'll want to do this so they have the temporary password and know how to login and set up their account.

**Groups**

- Also managed from [Google Apps](http://apps.google.com)
- There are a variety of groups setup for various projects but the main one new team members need to be added to is nerds@inn.org so they receive all of the email to the shared team account.
- To add someone to this group go to Groups > Technology > Manage users in group, add the new team member using their @INN email address and select "add as member"

**Calendar**

- We have a shared Google Calendar (INN - Technology) that all team members should be added to.
- From Google Calendar, click on the down arrow by the calendar name and select "share this calendar"
- Team members should be added using their @INN email address and the permissions will typically be "make changes to events AND manage sharing"


### Dropbox

- Team members need access to at least the main shared INN folder (because this is where we keep many shared docs and also the 1password keychain that you'll need in the next step)
- Optionally (particularly for FT staff who need to store a lot of stuff on dropbox without maxing out their personal account) we can add them to the INN organization (Adam is the account admin and the only person able to do this, unfortunately). Note that this costs money so we won't do it in every situation.


### 1password

- New team member will need to purchase, download and install 1password ([https://agilebits.com/store](https://agilebits.com/store))
- Then, follow the instructions here: [https://learn2.agilebits.com/1Password4/Mac/en/Tutorials/share-vault.html](https://learn2.agilebits.com/1Password4/Mac/en/Tutorials/share-vault.html) and use the INN keychain (in the main INN dropbox folder) to add a new vault. You will need to enter a confidential passphrase that you can get from Adam.
- This vault contains most of the login information we share among the staff/team (for things like social media accounts, etc.)


### HipChat

Note: HipChat account creation can only be done by someone with Admin/Owner privileges.

- Add new account using @INN email address (will send user an email invitation)
- An admin/owner to technology room(s)
- New user will need to click on a confirmation link in the email invitation
- And optionally they can download the HipChat desktop/mobile apps from the [HipChat website](http://hipchat.com)


### GitHub

- To add a user to any of our GitHub teams they need to first create a personal GitHub account.
- Assuming you know the new team member's account and are logged into GitHub, go to [https://github.com/orgs/INN/teams](https://github.com/orgs/INN/teams) and select the team you want to add the user to.
- Typically we'll add all team members to the "Tech Team" team and then optionally to "Owners" (for core team members) and "Secret" for people with permission to deploy sites/apps to production.


### Websites

- Typically we'll need to at least add new team members to the [team blog](http://nerds.inn.org) but they may also need access to other INN sites and/or to the Largo WP instance.
- User creation for any of these sites follows the typical WordPress multisite user creation process. Always use the person's @INN email address. Super admin privileges to the Largo instance should be granted sparingly (typically users only need access to certain sites and only certain permissions on those sites).
- For each WordPress instance a new team member is added to, they should fill out their profile as completely as possible.
- Avatars on Largo sites use [gravatar](http://gravatar.com) so new users will need to create a gravatar associated with their @INN email address for it to display correctly


### WP Engine

- Login to WP Engine and click on the "users" tab at the top of the dashboard
- From here you can add/manage users and the specific WordPress instances they have access to
- Additionally you will need to create (for users where this is required) FTP credentials and/or grant the user access to INN Secrets GitHub repo (see above) if they need to be able to deploy.


### Jira

- When logged in, click on the gear icon at the top right corner of the dashboard and then select "user management."
- From here select "create new user" and add their info (it will also give you an option to email them instructions to set their password, etc.)
- Once the account is created it will send you to their profile page where you will also likely need to change the groups they belong to (we're still working this out so more details on which groups they need to be added to will be added here eventually)

### HelloSign
-To create an account,you can connect HelloSign to an existing Google account from the HelloSign website.
