# Onboarding

How we get new team members setup to work with our systems and up to speed with what we're working on.

### What's in here (so far):
-  [A Sample Onboarding Plan](/staffing/onboarding/onboarding-plan.md)
-  [Account Creation](/staffing/onboarding/accounts.md) - The various services/apps/tools we need to add new team members to and how to go about doing that.
-  [OS X Setup](/staffing/onboarding/os-x-setup.md) - A baseline of OS X tools and configurations for use by a new team member.
